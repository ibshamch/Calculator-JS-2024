Understanding the outputResult()
How is javascript executed (top to bottom)
using constant 
opening closing '' '' should be same
"'' ''" 
string concatination 
string priority while working with numbers
backtiks `` with template literals (multi-lines)
escape characters \ 


## Till this everything was hardcoded
Functions -> code on demand , only run some function when something happens , looking at outputResult Function , 

adding a custom function add
function placement ( below variable or at the end of file )
variables automatically declared for the functions 
returning values


Order Matter of declaration : 
1- Declare variable before using them (Order Matter)
2- For function it is different , Javascript actually reads whole script first and automatically takes functions to the top before execution
3- You can declare function at the very bottom or just the way you like below variables


Local vs Global Scope : 
Variable declared outside functions are global (are available to functions as well but can cause side Effects)
Variable declared in functions are local or block scoped variables (not available to outside world other than function)

More on function : 
Only return gives back value from function 
Nothing executes after return in function
You may return nothing 
you cannot return more than one thing from a function


Converting types: 
ParseInt for converting string to number.
toString for converting number to string
++userInput.value


Spitting code into functions: 
Add dynamic Description right into the function
avoiding repeatation by custom variable name 
additional function that return parseInt(userInput) and then it is attatched to custom variable in add() function.
